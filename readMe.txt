This program is around 85% complete. My application is multi-threaded
allowing two clients to connect, message each other, and play a game of battleship.
Multiple clients can also connect and play a separate game of battleship and chat.

Bugs that need to be fixed:
- Buttons unclickable when new game with the same opponent
- one player disconnecting should end the game
- SocketException sometimes when a player disconnects
